## Problem Statement

Parkinson's disease diagnosis often requires specialized medical expertise and time-consuming clinical assessments. This project aims to provide a user-friendly and accessible solution for preliminary Parkinson's disease prediction.

## Our Solution

Our web app utilizes regression algorithms to analyze user-provided data and generate a prediction regarding the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. By leveraging Streamlit, we offer a seamless and interactive user interface for a hassle-free experience.

## Getting Started

To run the web app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sachchit-k/Ineuron_main_project_2.0.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Access the web app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Dataset

We utilized a carefully curated dataset containing relevant features associated with Parkinson's disease. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure optimal performance and accurate predictions.

## Regression Algorithms

We implemented various regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression, to build predictive models. These models were trained on the dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the presence of Parkinson's disease.

## Usage

1. Input the required information, such as age, gender, and specific motor symptom scores, into the web app's user interface.
2. Click the "Predict" button to generate a prediction regarding the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.
3. The web app will display the predicted probability and provide insights into the prediction based on the selected regression algorithm.
